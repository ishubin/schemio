Schemio
--------------------

Schemio is a web based diagramming app that allows you to build interactive diagrams. Although originally Schemio was not designed for this, but it is also possible to use it as a prototyping app.

Features of Schemio:

- Creating interactive diagrams
- Documenting individual items in your diagrams
- Linking diagrams. You can add links to other diagrams or to external documents
- Component based diagrams: you can load diagrams dynamically inside of each other. This allows you to manage your digrams better and lets the user discover more and more while staying in original document
- Frame animation editor: t is possible to use frame based animations for any property.
- Draw free-form shapes
- Relative transformations: you can attach items to other items in your diagrams and tweak rotation, pivot point and scale
- Behavior editor: you can assign event handlers to any item (events like: init, click, mouse in, mouse out)
- Various animation functions: you can have smooth transitions like fade in or fade out, move items, render particle effect etc.
- Export entire diagram or only selected objects as SVG
- Generate static version of all of your diagrams so that you can host it anywhere, even on GitHub pages
