                and we cannot guarantee the safety and privacy of your information.
                Before visiting and providing any information to any third-party websites, you should inform yourself of the privacy policies and practices (if any)

                no security measures are perfect or impenetrable, and no method of data transmission can be guaranteed against any interception or other type of misuse.
                Any information disclosed online is vulnerable to interception and misuse by unauthorized parties.
                Therefore, we cannot guarantee complete security if you provide personal information.

                <h3>Controls For Do-Not-Track Features</h3>

                <p>
                Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems include a Do-Not-Track (“DNT”) feature or setting you can activate to signal your 
                privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected.
                No uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized.
                As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online.
                If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this Privacy Policy.
                Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems include a Do-Not-Track (“DNT”) feature or setting you can activate to signal 
                your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected.
                If you set the DNT signal on your browser, we will respond to such DNT browser signals.
                </p>
